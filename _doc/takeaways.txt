- Prerequisites
  - Ganache is installed locally and is up and running

- In package.json add the following two scripts  
  - "generate-types": "npx typechain --target=truffle-v5 ./build/contracts/*.json",
  - "compile" : "truffle compile && npm run generate-types"  

- run the following command to compile contracts and generate types folder
  - npm run compile
    - you should have 5 typings generated  

- add tsconfig.json
  -  "typeRoots": [
            "./node_modules/@types",
            "./types"
      ] 
  - the types folder was created when you ran "npm run compile"

- migration
  - modify truffle-config.js
    - add require("ts-node").register({files: true}); #TA-01
      - this allows us to run migration written in TS
  - workaround as migration is not working for TS out-of-the-box
    - in step 2 requires a TS file #TA-02
    - implement the deployment of the contracts in the TS file #TA-03
        
- deploy contracts
  - command: truffle deploy --network development --reset
